/*  4)   Create a class A. Add several fields, two methods and parameterized constructors to it.
         Create a class B that extends class A.
         Demonstrate in you program how class's B constructor should call class's A constructor to create a new object.
         Override one method of the class A to fully change it's behavior. Override another method to add some
         extra functionality to it, but it should then call class's A method.
         Create a test class and create several objects of class A and class B and call their methods.*/
